# AI Voice Assistant

Hello, everyone!

I am excited to share the demo of my AI voice assistant, inspired by JARVIS from the Iron Man movies. This offline assistant is designed to recognize your voice commands, understand what you ask for, and provide accurate responses. It also supports several languages, and one of its unique abilities is to remember details from previous conversations, allowing it to offer smarter, context-aware answers.

This is our old voice assistant's GitHub repository that we started a long time ago.

> **Important Note:** This project is still under development. Because of this, it might run a bit slowly or sometimes even hang. A complete, fully functional version is expected by 2026. Your patience and feedback during this early stage are greatly appreciated.

## What the Project Does

- **Offline Functionality:** The assistant works without needing an internet connection. This ensures that you can use its voice recognition capabilities even in environments with limited or no connectivity.
  
- **Voice Recognition and Response:** When you speak, the assistant listens to your voice commands, interprets them, and replies with an appropriate answer. This behavior is inspired by the intuitive interfaces we see in movies.

- **Multilingual Support:** Language will not be a barrier. The system is designed to communicate in multiple languages, making it inclusive for users from different linguistic backgrounds.

- **Context Awareness:** By remembering past interactions, the assistant can offer responses that feel more natural and tailored to the conversation, enhancing your overall experience.

## Demo to See It in Action

A demonstration video is available for you to watch. In the video, you can see how the voice assistant operates in real time—from listening to your voice command to providing a response on the screen.
